# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

`C`	`Memory allocation`

### Concepts

*For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:*

 * [Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/62)

# Resources

**Read or watch:**

 * [Do I cast the result of malloc?](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/uKhvfzpF3v8Be10NCZlQtA)

**man or help:**

 * `malloc`

 * `free`

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/f-MGO-Fu4KSrem3R6GkEyw), **without the help of Google:**

## General

 * How to use the `exit` function

 * What are the functions `calloc` and `realloc` from the standard library and how to use them


# Requirements

## General

 * Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`

 * All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

 * All your files should end with a new line

 * A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

 * Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

 * You are not allowed to use global variables

 * No more than 5 functions per file

 * The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc` and `free`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden

 * You are allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)

 * You donâ€™t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it wonâ€™t be taken into account

 * In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples

 * The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`

 * Donâ€™t forget to push your header file


**Happy coding**ðŸŽ‰
