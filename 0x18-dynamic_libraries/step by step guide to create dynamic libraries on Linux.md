**You**: step by step giude to create dynamic libraries on Linux

**ChatGPT**: Here are the steps to create dynamic libraries on Linux:Create the source code for your library. This can be done in any programming language, but for this example, we'll use C. Here's an example source code:c
```c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
void greet()
{
   printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

Save this code in a file called ```libgreet.c```.Compile the source code into an object file. Use the following command:r
```r
$ gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic libgreet.c
```

This command tells the gcc compiler to compile the source code in ```libgreet.c``` and create a position-independent object file (```-fpic```). The ```-c``` flag tells the compiler not to link the code.Create the shared library. Use the following command:ruby
```ruby
$ gcc -shared -o libgreet.so libgreet.o
```

This command tells the gcc compiler to create a shared library called ```libgreet.so``` (```-o libgreet.so```) from the object file (```libgreet.o```) created in the previous step.Set the library path. Use the following command:shell
```shell
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/library:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

This command tells the operating system where to find the shared library when it is called by an executable. Replace ```/path/to/library``` with the path to your library.Test the shared library. Use the following command:css
```css
$ gcc -o main main.c -L/path/to/library -lgreet
$ ./main
```

This command compiles and links the main program (```main.c```) with the shared library (```-L/path/to/library -lgreet```). The ```-L``` flag tells the linker where to find the library and the ```-l``` flag tells the linker the name of the library. The resulting executable is called ```main```. When you run ```./main```, you should see the message "Hello, world!" printed to the console.

That's it! You've successfully created a dynamic library on Linux.
